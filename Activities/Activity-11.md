## Question

Dijkstra's algorithm is based on finding a minimum value for a potential path in a graph. Graphs with a negative weight involve can keep decreasing infinitely, so finding a minimum weight would be impossible. The algorithm goes by numerical value, 

## Example

If the weight of a graph represents a change in temperature from travelling in one location to another, such as a graph representing roads between a snow-covered mountain peak, a desert, and various temperate
