## Question 1

See Activity 6 Image 1. Each PUSH(S,n) adds the value *n* to the stack *S*, while each POPS(S) removes the latest value from *S*. By last-in, first-out, the most recent element added is the one that will be removed per POP(). The final result of the stack will just have the elements 4 and 1.

## Question 2

See Activity 6 Image 2. An ENQUEUE(Q,n) operation adds element *n* to the queue *Q*, while DEQUEUE(Q) removes the *earliest* value from *Q*. Unlike the stack's POP() operation, DEQUEUE() removes from the left end. The final result of the queue will have 3 and 8.
