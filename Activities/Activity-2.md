## Question 1

A linear search would take four steps to find the number 8 in the array, one for incrementing each unit.

## Question 2

For a binary search, the program would immediately find the number 8 as it is the central element, so it would only take one step.

## Question 3

A binary search's worst-case scenario (big O) search would be in log base 2 of the number of values. So an array of 100,000 would take up to log2(100,000) = log(100,000)/log2, which is approximately 17 searches. (About 16.6, rounded up because the decimal represents a "remainder" search.)

## Question 4

```c++
//Linear search in C++.
for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
{
if (array(i) = )
}

//Binary search in C++.
```
